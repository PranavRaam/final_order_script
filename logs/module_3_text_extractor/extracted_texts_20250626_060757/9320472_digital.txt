Pt continue to report multiple jt pain graded 6-8/10 chronic in nature, taking tylenol with fair relief. Denies sob at rest , ongoing sob with exertion, limits activity in addition to activity limited by multiple jt pain. Physical impairments noted: slows steady gait with B LE mm strength see section for details . Noted ongoing high risk of falling with Tinetti gait and balance score of 10/28, no gains since PT recertification assessment. This visit to require SBA with sit to stand, SBA with transfers and ambulation with rollator. This visit, completed approx 70 ft ambulation with rollator, gait continue to be unsteady with decrease foot clearance, decrease step and stride length with increase lean on rollator, PT recommended use of RW to improve safe management of AD in home and improve steady gait, pt not receptive. Pt progressing slowly with PT POC, she will continue to benefit with skilled PT 2x/wk to address physical impairments and limitations to improve mobility to max potential with decrease risk of falling, pt in agreement with PT POC Barros, Candida (MA231027083803) © 2004-2025 Kinnser Software, Inc.
