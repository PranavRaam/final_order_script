DME: cane, walker, grab bars, shower chair, bed bar. PLOF patient ambulates with walker device, supervision with all functional transfers and min assist with adls. CLOF this assessment, patient transfers with stand by assist with extra time, he requires mod assist for bed mobility. He ambulates up to 60 feet with SBA, using rollator, gait is slow, unsteady on turns, forward trunk lean with poor step clearance. Dynamic balance is poor plus, tinetti is 16/28. Patient with decreased functional endurance requires cues for pacing and longer rest periods due to easy fatigability. Patient is homebound due to decreased strength and endurance, requires assistance of 1 person and device to leave home due to high fall risk due to pain, balance issues and weakness. Skilled physical therapy necessary to provide functional mobility training, endurance training and teaching on home safety and fall prevention. Skilled Physical Therapy to instruct patient in mobility safety training to include body mechanics, strengthening exercises, ambulation, correct posture, bed mobility, proper transfer techniques. Patient with good rehab potential to meet goal of regain strength and walk safely again. Patient and wife in agreement with PT POC. Sousa, Joao (101000376) © 2004-2025 Kinnser Software, Inc.
