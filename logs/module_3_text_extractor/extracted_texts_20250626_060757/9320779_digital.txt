Patient's Goals: Regain PLOF; prevent falls. Precautions: Falls. Homebound? No Yes For a patient to be eligible to receive covered home health services under both Part A and Part B, the law requires that a physician certify in all cases that the patient is confined to his/her home. For purposes of the statute, an individual shall be considered "confined to the home" (homebound) if the following two criteria are met: Criteria One: Patient is confined because of illness, needs the aid of supportive devices such as crutches, canes, wheelchairs, and walkers; the use of special transportation; or the assistance of another person in order to leave their place of residence. AND/OR Patient has a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically contraindicated.

Criteria Two: Patient has a normal inability to leave home. AND Leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort for the patient. Specify: Impairments re: strength, balance, and functional activity tolerance, resulting in pt's functional decline and increased risk for falls.

PSH: AVR. Pt's PLOF includes being (I) throughout her home and community with RW. However, pt currently requires CG(A) to maintain safety. Pt has made functional gains since initial Eval, yet requires further progressions to attain LTGs/PLOF. Pt with recent Fall resulting in Ruib Fx's. Pt continues to demonstrate Impairments re: pain, strength, balance, and functional activity tolerance, resulting in pt's functional decline and increased risk for falls. Skilled PT is required to continue addressing impairments, increase strength, increase balance, increase functional activity tolerance, reduce pt's risk for falls, reduce pt's dependence on caregivers, facilitate pt's PLOF to resume safe community activity, restore pt's overall quality of life. Without skilled PT, pt is at risk for further decline, increased weakness, immobility, increased risk for falls/injury, and hospitalization.
