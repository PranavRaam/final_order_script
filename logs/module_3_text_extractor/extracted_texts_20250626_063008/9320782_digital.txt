No Yes For a patient to be eligible to receive covered home health services under both Part A and Part B, the law requires that a physician certify in all cases that the patient is confined to his/her home. For purposes of the statute, an individual shall be considered "confined to the home" (homebound) if the following two criteria are met: Criteria One: Patient is confined because of illness, needs the aid of supportive devices such as crutches, canes, wheelchairs, and walkers; the use of special transportation; or the assistance of another person in order to leave their place of residence. AND/OR Patient has a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically contraindicated. Specify: If the patient meets one of the criterion one conditions, then the patient must ALSO meet two additional requirements defined in criterion two below. Criteria Two: Patient has a normal inability to leave home. AND Leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort for the patient. Specify: Patient is homebound due to decreased balance, increased falls risk, dyspnea with minimal exertion, pain, decreased safety, decreased endurance, and requires assist of one person and rolling walker to (Continued) Rego, William (MA230619115702) Page 1 of 7 © 2004-2025 Kinnser Software, Inc.

Clinical Statement of Assessment Findings and Recommendations ABUSE,HYPONADISM IN MALE,LT GROIN ABSCESS,DENTAL INFECTION,SEVERE OBESITY,ASTHMA,COPD,DIABETIC NEUROPATHY. Patient has (DME) equipment: walker, shower chair, grab bars, cane, crutches, oxygen. PLOF patient ambulates without device, independent with all functional transfers and adl. Patient is homebound due to decreased balance, increased falls risk, dyspnea with minimal exertion, pain, decreased safety, decreased endurance, and requires assist of one person and rolling walker to leave the home. Patient continue to present with decreased safety and endurance with outdoor ambulation, decreased strength on lower extremities, impaired dynamic balance and needs further training on pain management, precautions, pacing techniques, home exercise program, home safety issues and symptom management. Physical therapy will continue to provide thera ex program for strengthening, provide endurance and balance activities, gait training to improve overall functional mobility to reach good functional baseline. Patient goal is to avoid falls, get stronger and decrease burden of care. Without physical therapy, patient is at risk for more falls and rehospitalization due to weakness, unsteadiness on feet and poor functional endurance. Patient in agreement with POC and vfo for the new cert period. Rego, William (MA230619115702) © 2004-2025 Kinnser Software, Inc. All Rights reserved.
