However, pt currently requires (S)/SB(A) to maintain safety. Pt has made functional gains since initial Eval, yet requires further progressions to attain LTGs/PLOF. Pt continues to demonstrate Impairments re: pain, strength, balance, and functional activity tolerance, resulting in pt's functional decline and increased risk for falls. Skilled PT is required to continue addressing impairments, decrease pain, increase strength, increase balance, increase functional activity tolerance, reduce pt's risk for falls, reduce pt's dependence on caregivers, facilitate pt's PLOF to resume safe community activity, restore pt's overall quality of life. Without skilled PT, pt is at risk for further decline, increased weakness, immobility, increased risk for falls/injury, and hospitalization.
