The patient needs to continue skilled PT services to help improve B LE strength, balance and endurance, therefore helping the patient reach the highest potential. Current status: Pt complains of chronic low back and bilateral knee pain of 7/10 (where: 0 = No pain and 10 = Worst pain possible); Bed mobility at Modified Independent; Sit <> stand and Transfers at CGA/SBA; Ambulatory with blind cane at CGA/SBA level x 30 ft on even surfaces with rests due to deficits of strength, endurance and balance; B LE strength of 3+ to 4-/5 grossly; High fall risk; Stair climbing at not tested this visit. Based on overall PT assessment, the patient needs to continue skilled PT services at this time to address deficits. Safety awareness emphasized during this visit to prevent future falls. OT Evaluation added to POC. Patient is a full code. Systems: Skin is warm, dry and intact; urinating and moving bowels without difficulty; vital signs are stable; lungs clear to auscultation; has a good appetite and is taking food and fluids without difficulty.
