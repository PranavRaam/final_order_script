Goal Term: long Target Date: 06/12/25 Patient will improve gait capacity as evidenced by the ability to ambulate with walker steadily for >200 feet to allow patient to access bedroom/bathroom and exit home for MD appts within 8 weeks. Goal Term: long Target Date: 06/12/25 Patient will improve dynamic balance as evidenced by the tinetti score from 14/28 to >20/28 to allow patient to perform all functional mobility and ADLs safely with decrease risk of fall. Goal Term: long Target Date: 06/12/25 Patient will have no falls during the episode of care Goal Term: long Target Date: 06/12/25 Finch, Darwin (MA210304014206) Page 7 of 7 © 2004-2025 Kinnser Software, Inc.

Patient with decreased functional endurance requires cues for pacing and longer rest periods due to easy fatigability. Patient is homebound due to decreased strength and endurance, requires assistance of 1 person and device to leave home due to high fall risk due to pain, balance issues and weakness. Skilled physical therapy necessary to provide functional mobility training, endurance training and teaching on home safety and fall prevention. Skilled Physical Therapy to instruct patient in mobility safety training to include body mechanics, strengthening exercises, ambulation, correct posture, bed mobility, proper transfer techniques. Patient with good rehab potential to meet goal of increasing strength and walk safely again. Patient and CG in agreement with PT POC. Finch, Darwin (MA210304014206) © 2004-2025 Kinnser Software, Inc.
