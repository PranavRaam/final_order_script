Clinical Statement of Assessment Findings and Recommendations assisting with ADLs and IADLS, medications and md appointments. Prior to fracture, patient ambulates with walker or crutches at times. He is independent with all functional transfers and adls. CLOF this assessment, patient is sit to stand lift with mod assist on all functional transfers and bed mobility with extra time. He is able to tolerate static standing for 90 seconds holding on a walker with CGA. Patient showing steady progress but continue to present with decreased safety and endurance with ambulation, decreased strength on lower extremities, impaired dynamic balance and needs further training on pain management, precautions, pacing techniques, home exercise program, home safety issues and symptom management. Physical therapy will continue to provide thera ex program for strengthening, provide endurance and balance activities, gait training to improve overall functional mobility to reach good functional baseline. Patient goal is to walk again, get stronger and decrease burden of care. Patient in agreement with POC and vfo for the remainder of cert period.
