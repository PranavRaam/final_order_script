Patient's Goals: Regain PLOF; prevent falls. Precautions: Falls. Homebound? No Yes For a patient to be eligible to receive covered home health services under both Part A and Part B, the law requires that a physician certify in all cases that the patient is confined to his/her home. For purposes of the statute, an individual shall be considered "confined to the home" (homebound) if the following two criteria are met: Criteria One: Patient is confined because of illness, needs the aid of supportive devices such as crutches, canes, wheelchairs, and walkers; the use of special transportation; or the assistance of another person in order to leave their place of residence. AND/OR Patient has a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically contraindicated. Specify: If the patient meets one of the criterion one conditions, then the patient must ALSO meet two additional requirements defined in criterion two below. Criteria Two: Patient has a normal inability to leave home. AND Leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort for the patient. Specify: Impairments re: strength, balance, and functional activity tolerance, resulting in pt's functional decline and increased risk for falls.

Clinical Statement of Assessment Findings and Recommendations cervical with myelopathy, lumbosacral other DDD, MDD recurrent, muscle wasting and atrophy of multiple sites, fall, OSA, rt carotid occlusion hx, GERD, left shoulder pain. PSH: Cataract sx, carotid stenting, intraocular lens, bariatric surgery. Pt's PLOF includes being (I) throughout her home and community with Rollator/Electric WC. However, pt currently requires (S) to maintain safety. Pt has made functional gains since initial Eval, yet requires further progressions to attain LTGs/PLOF. Pt continues to demostrate Impairments re: strength, balance, and functional activity tolerance, resulting in pt's functional decline and increased risk for falls. Skilled PT is required to address impairments, increase strength, increase balance, increase functional activity tolerance, reduce pt's risk for falls, reduce pt's dependence on caregivers, facilitate pt's PLOF to resume safe community activity, restore pt's overall quality of life. Without skilled PT, pt is at risk for further decline, increased weakness, immobility, increased risk for falls/injury, and hospitalization. Goals and Interventions Note: (5 of 6) Patient will Improve mobility as evidenced by a TUG Score of 13.5 seconds using Rollator for in-home mobility without fall risk Interventions Performed (1) Physical Therapy to develop and manage a balance program focused on static/dynamic balance activities to address pt's risk for falls.
