Clinical Statement of Assessment Findings and Recommendations cervical with myelopathy, lumbosacral other DDD, MDD recurrent, muscle wasting and atrophy of multiple sites, fall, OSA, rt carotid occlusion hx, GERD, left shoulder pain. PSH: Cataract sx, carotid stenting, intraocular lens, bariatric surgery. Pt's PLOF includes being (I) throughout her home and community with Rollator/Electric WC. However, pt currently requires SB(A)/(S) to maintain safety. Pt has made functional gains since initial Eval, yet requires further progressions to attain LTGs/PLOF. Pt continues to demostrate Impairments re: strength, balance, and functional activity tolerance, resulting in pt's functional decline and increased risk for falls. Skilled PT is required to address impairments, increase strength, increase balance, increase functional activity tolerance, reduce pt's risk for falls, reduce pt's dependence on caregivers, facilitate pt's PLOF to resume safe community activity, restore pt's overall quality of life. Without skilled PT, pt is at risk for further decline, increased weakness, immobility, increased risk for falls/injury, and hospitalization.

Clinical Statement of Assessment Findings and Recommendations and community with RW. However, pt currently requires CG(A)/SB(A) to maintain safety. Pt has made ROM and functional gains since initial Eval, yet requires further progressions to attain LTGs/PLOF. Pt continues to demonstrate Impairments re: pain, ROM, strength, balance, and functional activity tolerance, resulting in pt's functional decline and increased risk for falls. Skilled PT is required to continue addressing impairments, decrease pain, increase ROM, increase strength, increase balance, increase functional activity tolerance, reduce pt's risk for falls, reduce pt's dependence on caregivers, facilitate pt's PLOF to resume safe community activity, restore pt's overall quality of life. Without skilled PT, pt is at risk for further decline, decreased ROM, increased pain, increased weakness, immobility, increased risk for falls/injury, and hospitalization.

Pt continues to demonstrate Impairments re: pain, strength, balance, and functional activity tolerance, resulting in pt's functional decline and increased risk for falls. Skilled PT is required to continue addressing impairments, decrease pain, increase strength, increase balance, increase functional activity tolerance, reduce pt's risk for falls, reduce pt's dependence on caregivers, facilitate pt's PLOF to resume safe community activity, restore pt's overall quality of life. Without skilled PT, pt is at risk for further decline, increased weakness, immobility, increased risk for falls/injury, and hospitalization.
